# Video-Dub
Video-Dub is a project demonstrating the task of speech-to-speech translation from Swahili to English by breaking down the system into 3 components; speech recognition, text to text machine translation and text to speech synthesis.
The project contains a speech recognition model, and uses Google Cloud's text to text machine translation and speech synthesis.
